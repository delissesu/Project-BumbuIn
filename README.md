# Project-BumbuIn
Final Project for Algorithms and Programming Semester 1.
My first project as a student who's learning about computer science.
NOTE:
This project was collaboratively completed with two of my friends over the span of a week, with some support from AI in its execution. A key takeaway from this project for future endeavors is that reliance on AI can be reduced.
